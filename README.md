# Unit 2 - Store Management Project

## Introduction

You are opening a new business in your community! Businesses often need programs to manage the products and services they offer and track orders and requests from customers. Your goal is to create a store management system for your business.

## Requirements

Use your knowledge of object-oriented programming and class structure and design to create your store management system:
- **Create a class hierarchy** – Develop a superclass that represents a product or service your business offers and one or more subclasses that extend the superclass to represent more specific types of products or services.
- **Declare instance variables** – Declare instance variables in the superclass that are shared with the subclasses and instance variables in the subclasses that are not shared with the superclass.
- **Write constructors** – Write no-argument and parameterized constructors in the superclass and subclasses. Subclass constructors use the super keyword to call the superclass constructor.
- **Implement accessor and mutator methods** – Write accessor and mutator methods for instance variables that should be accessible and/or modifiable from outside of the class.
- **Implement a toString() method** – Write toString() methods in the superclass and subclasses that return information about the state of an object.

## Description

In my project, what inspired me about it is what a bakery sells and what it focuses on such as the price, how much of one item, and flavor or how sweet it is. I based the instance variables in my code off of that kind of thinking. When the code is ran, it give you the option to input a price, amount of each item(between cupcakes and boba), if it is sweet, and the flavor/if it has sprinkles depending on the subclass. it displays the information neatly after. Then, it puts the constructors to the test bu calling and adding values to test it's capabilities. Overall, the code ive developed is functional and works as it should.
